# Technical Portfolio - Case Studies

## Overview

This repository serves as a technical portfolio documenting real-world projects I've developed, focusing on architecture, process flow, and technical decision-making. The repository contains **documentation only** - no source code is included.

## Confidentiality Constraints

⚠️ **Important Notice**: The actual source code for these projects is not publicly available as these solutions were implemented for companies in the private financial sector and other sensitive industries. All information shared here respects strict confidentiality guidelines, including:

- No proprietary source code
- No sensitive business logic or algorithms
- No customer data or internal metrics
- No company-specific implementation details

The case studies focus on **architecture patterns**, **process flows**, **technical challenges**, and **decision-making frameworks** that can be discussed without compromising confidential information.
